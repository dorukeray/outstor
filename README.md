# Outstor

## What?

Outstor is a simple and lightweight storage library for PHP. <br>Outstor is a component of the Outsights framework, but also independent, so anyone can use it.

## Why?

Because writing storage-layer code in vanilla PHP is really frustrating. It's too much burden on the developer. But also using a framework just to make the work easy is overkill. So we thought it would be great to have a storage library 

## How?

Simple. Use your favorite dependency util and autoload the `Dorkodu\Outstor` namespace.

If want to see everything you need, check out the [docs](DOCS.md).

### **It has a few components, and more on the way :**

- **DB :** a PDO wrapper.
- **SQLQuery :** a SQL query builder.
- **FileStorage :** useful and intuitive API for file system operations.

### Here is a sample :
